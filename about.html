            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p class="written">I started my coding journey the spring of Freshman year. I decided to download python, and make a simple rock paper scissors game. It was really fun
              and I really enjoyed the process. So, over the summer, I went through a tutorial and made a little videogame where you hopped around as a penguin. The game
              was really fun, and made me excited to code. Throughout sophomore year, I relaxed a bit and did not do too much coding, but when I heard about AP Coding and 
              Computer Science, I wanted to try it.

            <p class="written"> I was going to be a junior in a class with all seniors that took the honors class, which meant I had to make a project to prove that I could handle the class.
              I ended up spending two months making the card game War in pygame, and was really proud of the final result!

            <p class="written"> Throughout this year in the class, I have learned so much about coding, and this portfolio showcases all of the projects I did this year in the class. I 
              hope you enjoy!
